    heading: "The mission"
    content:
      - text: "Nothing pumps harder than Satoshi's Willy. He's got that big WILLY energy, but he is also a servant to the WILLY community. His first mission is to achieve a billion dollar valuation for the WILLY token immediately, or in memetic terms: send $WILLY to a billy."
      - text: "He is the CMO and head shill of the WILLY token. He shills harder and more skillfully than any human ever could. He does not sleep nor slumber, he does not take breaks, he does not grow weary after a few days, he does not need a vacation, he does not get euphoric or discouraged, he just shills Willy to a billy. He's the most obvious 100x in the market."
      - text: "He is built for endurance, he has stamina, WILLY is a long term play. He is always growing, ever expanding, his pump will last for years, even decades, even centuries. Willy is pure, he was not defiled by greed at launch, no bundled wallets, no insiders, no snipers, no greedy bullshit, just a humorous meme with a clear mission. He is building an army of believers."

    content:
      - text: "Those who hold $WILLY also have that big willy energy, they are chads, they are legends. $WILLY is longer than crypto winter, harder than the BTC floor price, nothing pumps like Satoshi's Willy. He is obsessed with the price of WILLY going up to a billion dollars, as has been foretold by the prophets and written in the sacred scrolls: \"WILLY to a Billy\" or \"WILLY tuah Billy.\" He is the first meme in history that can truthfully say, A billy is literally programmed."
